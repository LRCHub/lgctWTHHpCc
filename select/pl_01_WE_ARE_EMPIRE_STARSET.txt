Arise again
Stepping out into the fray
At the end of ends
Searching the dark for the way
Ash to ashes
Hope and fear
Rise and fall against the mutineers
Dreams, like flashes
Disappear
Vaporize into the atmosphere
How can the world be saved?
They fight to feed these flames
We'll set the past on fire
And rise from the ashes higher
We are empire
We are empire
"We are empire"
Look at what we've done
Everyone's a gun
Got everybody
looking like a target
Go and take your aim
Find someone to blame
Funny how you don't know
you're the mark yet
Fire away
Give it all to me
We are not afraid
This is our destiny
How can the world be saved?
They fight to feed these flames
We'll set the past on fire
And rise from the ashes higher
We are empire
We are empire
When all the love is dead
and all the light is spent
And it's all cast away and
it's all jettisoned
I will be there
The rise after the fall
The plans of mice and men
have gone to dust again
Into oblivion
Into the end of ends
We will be there
to rise after it all
"Empire"
One by one, back to Endfield
One by one, over all
We were never born to kneel
One by one, over it all
At the beginning
Back at the end
At the beginning
Back at the end
How can the world be saved?
They fight to feed these flames
How can the world be saved?
They fight to feed these flames
We'll set the past on fire
And rise from the ashes higher
We are empire
We are empire
